# Marketing-Campaign-Tableau-Dashboard
## Marketing campaign data of 2,240 customers of HEB Store, including customer profiles, product preferences, campaign successes/failures, and channel performance.

## Create a dashboard to help management to understand the following:
1. What factors are significantly related to the number of web purchases?
2. Which marketing campaign was the most successful?
3. What does the average customer look like?
4. Which products are performing best?
5. Which channels are underperforming?
